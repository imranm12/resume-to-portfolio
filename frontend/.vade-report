# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Component Integration (app/layout.tsx)
- Imported `SpeedInsights` component from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the existing `<Analytics />` component
- Preserved all existing code structure and functionality

## Implementation Details

The project uses Next.js 16.1.6 with the App Router pattern, which is version 13.5+. This allowed us to use the simple integration approach:
- Import from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
- Add the component directly to the root layout without needing a separate client component

The SpeedInsights component was placed after the existing Analytics component within the body tag, following the same pattern already established in the codebase.

## Verification

✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build)
✅ No new linting errors introduced
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All 7 routes generated successfully

## Files Modified

- `frontend/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component
- `frontend/package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. Speed Insights will automatically track Core Web Vitals and performance metrics when deployed to Vercel.
