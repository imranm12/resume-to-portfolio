# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation Report

## Summary
Vercel Web Analytics has already been successfully implemented in this Next.js project. The implementation was completed in a previous commit (ba2eeeb).

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Package Installation
- **Package**: `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1
- **Location**: Listed in `package.json` dependencies
- **Status**: Successfully installed and verified via `npm list @vercel/analytics`

### ✅ Component Integration
- **Router Type**: App Router (using `app/` directory)
- **Integration File**: `frontend/app/layout.tsx`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/next`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag
  - Positioned after `{children}` as recommended

### ✅ Code Structure
```typescript
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable}`}>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ **Dependencies Installation**: Ran `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
2. ✅ **Package Verification**: Confirmed `@vercel/analytics@1.6.1` is correctly installed
3. ✅ **Build Test**: Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
   - Build completed without errors
   - All routes generated successfully (/, /how-it-works, /portfolio, /templates)
4. ✅ **Linter Check**: Ran `npm run lint`
   - No new errors introduced by Analytics implementation
   - Existing linting issues are unrelated to Analytics (pre-existing code quality issues)
5. ✅ **Lock File**: `package-lock.json` is up-to-date and committed

## Project Structure
